The example shows how to realize the following functions with ZW3D APIs:

1..IGS file export:
    Use "~FileSaveIgs" command to save active file as an "igs" file .
    The following function shows how to save active file as "igs" format:
        int FileSaveIgs(void);

2.IGS file import:
    Use "~FileLoadIgs" command to import specified "igs" file to active file.
    The following function shows how to import specified "igs" file:
        int FileLoadIgs(void);

The igs file will be exported to following path:
   "C:\test.igs"
