The example shows how to realize the following function with ZW3D APIs:

1.Create 3D trimmed surface:
    Use "!NurbsSurface" command to create a 3D Nurbs trimmed surface.
    The following function shows how to create the surface:
        int NurbsSurface(void);

Note that faces created by cvxPartFace() will not add successfully to the
active part unless there is an active feature (i.e. history operation) for
them to link to. So the example use .tcmd file "NurbsSurface.tcmd" to
define a "Custom Feature" and link the 3D trimmed surface to it.
